# Keylogger

This is a basic keylogger script written in Python using the pynput library.

## Features

- Logs keystrokes to a file (`log.txt`) in the working directory.
- Starts logging on script execution.
- Stops logging when the Escape key is pressed.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the `pynput` library (`pip install pynput`).
3. Run the script (`python main.py`).
4. Press `Esc` to stop logging.

## Notes

- This keylogger script is a demonstration of my Python programming skills.
- It showcases my ability to work with external libraries (`pynput`) for keyboard monitoring.
- The script follows best practices such as handling key events, writing to files, and program flow control.
- I created this project to explore cybersecurity concepts, particularly the potential vulnerabilities of keylogging and the importance of secure coding practices.
- As a responsible developer, I emphasize that this script is for educational purposes only. I do not condone or support any form of malicious use.
- Feel free to reach out to me with any questions about the project or my coding practices.
